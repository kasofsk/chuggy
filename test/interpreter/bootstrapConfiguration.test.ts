/**
 * The configuration a repository declaring none starts on: that it is a
 * configuration at all, that a release would take it, and that the file it is
 * seeded as is one an import reads back.
 *
 * THE GENERATOR IS CHECKED THROUGH THE DOORS THAT WOULD TAKE IT rather than
 * against a remembered document. What matters about it is that the authoring
 * door accepts the bytes and that release does not refuse them; a suite
 * asserting the text would pass while the shape release wants moved under it.
 *
 * IT COMMANDS NO CHECK ON PURPOSE, so the case that a ticket carrying check
 * lines is unreleasable against it is asserted here rather than left to be
 * discovered on a repository nobody has configured yet.
